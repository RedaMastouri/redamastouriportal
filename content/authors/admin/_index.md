I am a data scientist with experience solving classification and demand-forecasting problems with statistics, machine learning, and deep learning. I have strong interests in artificial intelligence and programming, having completed a Master of Science in Analytics at the [University of Chicago](https://professional.uchicago.edu/find-your-fit/masters/master-science-analytics/curriculum). I am currently studying advanced computer science topics in C++ at [University of Washington Bothell](https://www.uwb.edu/stem/graduate/gcsdd). In my free time, I enjoy running, photography, and reading. I have finished two Chicago marathons and three half marathons.
