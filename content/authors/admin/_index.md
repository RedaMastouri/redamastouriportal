I am a data scientist with experience solving classification and demand-forecasting problems with statistics, machine learning, and deep learning. I have strong interests in artificial intelligence and programming, having completed a Master of Science in Analytics at the [Saint Peter's University](https://www.saintpeters.edu/academics/graduate-programs/master-of-science-in-data-science/). I am currently studying PhD in Decision Networks and Artificial Intelligence at [Smart Systems Labs, ENSIAS, Med V University, Morocco](http://ensias.um5.ac.ma/). In my free time, I enjoy running, painting, photography, and reading. I have finished two NY Triathlons marathons and three half marathons.
